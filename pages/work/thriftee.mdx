This project was done as a submission to hackUST 2022, the largest hackathon in Asia. We tackled the theme of ESG and Smart Shopping / Spending / Living Experience in The Era of Information Overflow.

## Background
We started by identifying the gap in the market, and topics being discussed regarding sustainability. One such topic is fast fashion. Nowadays, mainstream fashion culture is moving at a breakneck speed: on top of the switching of styles every season, certain brands are pushing for new sets every month, and some “hype” brands even doing new drops every other week. The immense waste that goes into producing the items, as well as packaging and international shipping in the age of remote shopping, is often not talked about enough. As the turnover rate of clothing items increasing, more and more clothes that haven’t been used to their fullest end up in the landfills faster.

On the other hand, we noticed that a “thrifting” counter-culture is on the rise in Western countries, where consumers buy and consequently mix and match used clothing items donated from or sold by other people at a discounted price, creating its own genre of fashion. However, in Eastern cultures (such as in Hong Kong), there is a stigma to wearing other people’s clothes, as it might risk the wearer looking “cheap”.

Therefore, our solution aims to promote the culture of thrifting to the local scene, thereby reducing waste by preventing old clothes being thrown away; and at the same time satisfy consumers’ needs, so they reduce the amount of new clothes to buy, therefore reducing the demand for more clothing items and their subsequent waste being produced.


## Features
For this hackathon, we have created this website as a way to showcase our project.

There are two main flows of interacting with this website:

#### Customer
As a customer, you can:
1. Browse the marketplace by the 3 categories:
    - Women
    - Men
    - Kids
The marketplace screen contains a list of product cards, each with information such as an image of the item, brand and name of the item, the price and the estimated water consumption used to produce the item.
2. Inspect details of a product by clicking onto a product card
3. Add a product to your cart by clicking on the "Add to Cart" button
4. Choose your means of delivering the product using the dropdown in the cart, and seeing the CO2 emissions of each method. By choosing to delay on the delivery and choosing less wasting delivery methods, the delivery process becomes more environmentally friendly through easier planning for bulk delivery on delivery companies' part.
5. Check out your cart by clicking on the "Checkout" button

#### Donator
As a donator, you can:
1. Add a product to the marketplace by clicking on the "Add Donation Item" button
2. Input details of your donation item, including name, weight, and images of the item. Once the items are inputted, an estimated amount of rewards given to you will be calculated. The heavier the items, the more you are saving on the emission and waste that goes into producing and distributing the goods, as a result you get a larger sum of rewards. Right now, you get 50 Thriftee Dollars per kg of items donated, which can translate to different vouchers.
3. Submit your donation item by clicking on the "Confirm" button
4. Download an auto-generated shipping label with the information of your donation, including user ID, items donated, estimated rewards, etc. An QR code is also generated on the shipping label to ease the process of processing the donation.
